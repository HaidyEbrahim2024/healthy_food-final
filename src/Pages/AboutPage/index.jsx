              Eating Healthy Foods provides health benefits â€” people who eat
              more fruits and vegetables as part of an overall healthy diet are
              likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Fruits
              provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of your body.
            </p>
            <p>
              Healthy Foods are sources of many essential nutrients that are
              underconsumed, including potassium, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and
              folate (folic acid)
            </p>
            <p>
              Most Healthy Foods are naturally low in fat, sodium, and calories.
              None have cholesterol.
