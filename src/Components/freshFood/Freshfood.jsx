          <h2>Important to eat Healthy Food</h2>
          <p>
            Eating healthy foods provides health benefits â€” people who eat more fruits
            and vegetables as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have
            a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Fruits provide nutrients
            vital for health and maintenance of your body.
          </p>
          <p>
          healthy foods  are sources of many essential nutrients that are
            underconsumed, including potassium, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and
            folate (folic acid).
          </p>
          <p>
            Most  healthy foods  are naturally low in fat, sodium, and calories. None
            have cholesterol.
